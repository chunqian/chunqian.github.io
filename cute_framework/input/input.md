# Input

Input in CF comes from two headers, the [input header](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_input.h) and the [joypad header](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_joypad.h). Each header contains too many tiny functions to document for now, but they should all be quite self-explanatory or have in-comments documentation available.

The [input header](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_input.h) is for keyboard, mouse, touch, and IME user input.

The [joypad header](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_joypad.h) is for generalized joystick/gamepad support.
