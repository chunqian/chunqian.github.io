# Math

CF comes with a [2D math library](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_math.h) for vectors, matrices, and transforms. CF also comes along with a bunch of collision detection functions, some of which are highly advanced. Here is a list of the various kinds of collision shapes supported.

* Circle
* AABB
* Capsule
* Polygon
* Ray

There is too much information to document right here, so please check out the [math header itself](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_math.h) for a bunch of in-comments documentation.

There is also a custom implementation of psuedo-random number generation documented in the [rnd](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/tree/master/doc/math/rnd) section.
