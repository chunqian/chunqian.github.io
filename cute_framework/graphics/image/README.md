# Image

These functions are low-level functions to deal with loading PNG files to get direct access to the pixels. In Cute other higher level systems are probably what you're looking for, as these PNG functions are used to build the other higher level graphics systems in Cute.

* If you want to make textures for the GPU then you need [texture](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/tree/master/doc/graphics/texture).
* If you want to make sprites out of raw PNG files, and add your own animation data to them, then you need [png_cache](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/tree/master/doc/graphics/png_cache).
* If you want to load aseprite files into sprites then you need [aseprite_cache](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/tree/master/doc/graphics/aseprite_cache).
