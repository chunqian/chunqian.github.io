# Texture

These functions make/destroy sokol_gfx.h textures (`sg_image` instances) for the GPU. In order to learn how to properly use sokol graphics take a peek at the [primer here](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/doc/graphics/sokol.md). These functions are fairly low-level, and are intended for advanced users looking to implement their own custom graphics effects.

If you just want to draw sprites on screen it is recommend you use [aseprite_cache](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/doc/graphics/aseprite_cache) instead.

[texture_make](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/doc/graphics/texture/texture_make.md)  
[texture_destroy](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/doc/graphics/texture/texture_destroy.md)
