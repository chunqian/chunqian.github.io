Modules
============

DOME includes a number of modules to interact with the user through graphics and audio, access their inputs and hard drive. It also has a few useful utilities for mathematical operations.

The modules you can import are here:

* [audio](audio)
* [dome](dome)
* [graphics](graphics)
* [input](input)
* [io](io)
* [json](json)
* [math](math)
* [plugin](plugin)
* [random](random)

For example, the `graphics` module can be imported to access the `Canvas` and `Color` classes, like this:

```wren
import "graphics" for Canvas, Color

...

Canvas.cls()
Canvas.print("Hello world", 20, 20, Color.white)
```
